# Aeds2

These are Object-Oriented Programming exercises from the AEDS2 course. Most of the exercises were done in Java and some in C, with sorting structures in main and secondary memory for the attributes of Star Wars characters.
The "characters" folder is composed of characters from the Star Wars saga, and inside each "TP" (Practical Work) folder, there are the statements of the exercise lists.
